# Sentence Reconstruction Project

This project takes as input a sequence of words corresponding to a random permutation of a given English sentence and reconstructs the original sentence.

The output can be generated either in a single shot or through an iterative (autoregressive) loop, producing one token at a time.

## Execution

This is a Colab notebook, and the total execution time can be quite long (approximately 3 hours). To speed up the process, it is recommended to load the pre-trained model weights.

## Model Weights

The model weights (around 150 MB zipped) can be downloaded from the following link:

Please note that you will need my authorization to access the weights.
